Here is what I achevied in this project:
###Step 1
* Created a new branch in git `$ git branch mozart-edition` from main.
* Changed to the new branch `$ git checkout mozart-edition`
* Added my new branch to GitHub `$ git push --set-upsteam origin mozart-edition`
* Made changes in Mozart Project (`$ git add .` `$ git commit -m "changes"` `$ git push`
###Step 2
* Changed back to my __main__ branch to merge some files from _mozart-edition_ `$ git checkout main`
* Merged the specific files in _my mozart project_ to main by `$ git checkout mozart-edition *filename*/file.txt
* Checked the status to make sure I had added the files I needed `$ git status`
* Added the files to be staged `$ git add .`
* Commited my changes `$ git commit -m "merged project mozart"`
* Pushed my changes over to GitHub `$ git push`

* I also edited this README.md on GitHub so I have to remember `$ git pull` so I will have an updated file in my local git.


Anyhow Im off to bed as I have stayed up late enjoying this experience!
